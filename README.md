# Data-Science-52-Weeks
In this repository, I will attempt to do around 30 projects centered around Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI in 52 weeks. This is to challenge myself to build data science projects, convert them into a data science portfolio, and learn along the way.
This can span into data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, etc.
You can fork this repository to draw inspiration or continue my footsteps.
