# Data-Science-52-Weeks
In this repository, I will attempt to do around 30 data science projects in 52 weeks. This is to challenge myself to build data science projects, convert them into a data science portfolio, and learn along the way.
This can span into data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, etc.
You can fork this repository to draw inspiration or continue my footsteps.
